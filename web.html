       The World Wide Web (WWW),</a> commonly known as the Web, is an
       <strong><u>information system</u> where documents and other web resources are
       identified by Uniform Resource Locators</strong>
       (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked
        by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources
        of the WWW are transfered via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
         (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application
          called a web browser and are published by a software application
          called a web server.</p><img src="coding.JFIF" width="300">
